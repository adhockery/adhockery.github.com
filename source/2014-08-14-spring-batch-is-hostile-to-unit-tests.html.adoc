- Can't create a `JobBuilderFactory` or `StepBuilderFactory` without a `JobRepository` or `PlatformTransactionManager`.
- To create a `JobRepository` (using `SimpleJobRepository`) I need 4 different DAOs. At least it's an interface so it can be replaced with a stub.
- Try to pass parameters to a `Tasklet`
  - `ChunkContext` requires a `StepContext` which requires a `StepExecution` which requires a `JobExecution` which requires a `JobInstance`
  - `StepContribution` requires a `StepExecution`, etc.
