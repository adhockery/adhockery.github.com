    <div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s nothing more boring than an <em>"I moved my blog"</em> post but a couple of people have actually asked me to write up something about why I chose Tumblr &amp; how I used <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> to help me build the theme. So – sorry – here&#8217;s my <em>"I moved my blog"</em> post…</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> for my blog for a while now &amp; I&#8217;ve been very happy with it. However, I recently acquired an iPad mini &amp; I&#8217;d like to be able to use that to compose &amp; publish blog posts. Whilst composing is no problem using an app like <a href="http://bywordapp.com/">Byword</a> I need a unix terminal to publish posts when they&#8217;re ready.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I started looking for a new blogging service that:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lets me post <strong>and</strong> edit with <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>. No hand rolled HTML &amp; no crappy WYSIWYG editor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t require me to host anything myself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allows to keep my domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allows me to customize the template in a reasonably sane way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supports syntax highlighting. Gist embedding is all very well but gets missed by search bots &amp; mobilizers unless a <code>noscript</code> tag is present. I&#8217;d rather just use a regular <code>pre &gt; code</code> block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enables me to compose &amp; publish posts with my iPad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lets me migrate posts from Octopress. Manually is fine as there aren&#8217;t <em>that</em> many &amp; they&#8217;re already markdown formatted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lets me keep the same post URLs or specify redirects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supports Disqus comments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect2">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>No markdown support. No thanks.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="posterous"><a href="https://posterous.com/">Posterous</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The future seems in doubt after being acquired by Twitter. Worse, Posterous doesn&#8217;t allow linking to external scripts which means no Google Code Prettify &amp; I&#8217;d lose all my Disqus comments.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recently there&#8217;s been a trend for Dropbox based micro-blogging services &amp; the first I came across was Calepin. Whilst I was impressed by the simplicity of the setup it does <em>not</em> let you customize your blog template. I get why &amp; I think it&#8217;s a cool service but it&#8217;s not for me.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Invite-only (I&#8217;m still waiting :-().</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="scriptogram"><a href="http://scriptogr.am/">Scriptogram</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scriptogram seemed like a good fit. Posts are just markdown files in a Dropbox folder. They use a YAML header similar to the one used by Octopress to specify the timestamp, URL slug, tags and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Editing the blog template is a little less convenient, though. It&#8217;s similar to Tumblr&#8217;s mechanism where you edit the HTML template and CSS in the browser. In reality this means editing in a text editor then copy &amp; pasting into the browser. It&#8217;s not ideal but not a total disaster either. However, I found a few limitations with the Scriptogram templates such as the blog strapline being arbitrarily limited to 131 characters &amp; the fact it seemed to be impossible to get the post timestamp in a format that would allow me to include a valid HTML5 <code>time</code> tag. Tumblr&#8217;s templating while similar seemed a lot more mature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scriptogram has no facility for defining redirects so I&#8217;d have to use a CDN to maintain old post URLs. Worse, posts are served up under <code>/post/my-post-title</code> <em>and</em> under <code>/my-post-title</code>. The latter appears to be a bug &amp; no <code>canonical</code> link is rendered in the header to point to the correct URL.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="tumblr">Tumblr</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I already contribute to a Tumblr - <a href="http://hipsterdevstack.tumblr.com/">Hipster Dev Stack</a>, (you probably haven&#8217;t heard of it) - and find it pretty good for short form blogging. It&#8217;s also got a decent iOS client that accepts markdown input.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also like the fact that tumblr allows different post <em>types</em>; links, quotes, photos, etc. I&#8217;m not sure how much I&#8217;ll use them on this blog but it&#8217;s nice to have the option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tumblr also ticked the other boxes; I can define redirects so that links to old post URLs won&#8217;t break, I can include Disqus comments &amp; include external scripts for prettifying code.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="migrating-to-tumblr">Migrating to Tumblr</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="migrating-posts">Migrating posts</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One thing Tumblr <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> have is a tool for importing posts from another service so I had to copy &amp; paste my Octopress posts. Tedious but not difficult. Luckily they were all in markdown format anyway and included a timestamp in the header that could be pasted into Tumblr as is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I used Tumblr&#8217;s redirect facility to set up redirects from the old post URLs to the new ones. Again this is a tedious manual process but luckily I didn&#8217;t have <em>that</em> many posts to migrate.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="syntax-highlighting">Syntax highlighting</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I linked Google Code Prettify, added a small script block to add the <code>prettyprint</code> class to any <code>pre &gt; code</code> blocks &amp; copied some CSS rules into my theme.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="comments">Comments</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I just had to migrate my <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> comments' URLs. Thankfully <em>Disqus</em> makes that pretty easy - you can just upload a CSV file that maps old URLs to new ones.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="theming">Theming</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;d got quite far building a theme for Scriptogram but it was easy to adapt it to Tumblr.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike Scriptogram Tumblr expects you to inline CSS in the HTML template. You can upload and link to a separate file but can&#8217;t subsequently edit it so that seems like something to do once the bugs are ironed out. I also wanted to use a pre-processor to maintain my sanity. The workflow was initially pretty cumbersome:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>edit LESS file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>compile &amp; pipe output to clipboard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>select existing CSS block in the template and paste over the top</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>copy entire template and paste into Tumblr&#8217;s editor</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This got old pretty fast so I decided to automate it a little. I created a <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> build file that compiled LESS and merged it into the template HTML. That meant I could run <code>grunt &amp;&amp; cat dist/template.html | pbcopy</code> and then paste into Tumblr&#8217;s editor. Still not perfect but the fiddly bit – selecting and pasting over the inline CSS – is gone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can check out <a href="https://github.com/robfletcher/adhockery-tumblr">the blog theme and its Grunt build</a> on GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;d like to update the Grunt build to have a <em>production</em> mode that will generate an external CSS file, upload it to Tumblr&#8217;s CDN and merge a link into the template instead of the inline CSS.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If it wasn&#8217;t for the fact I wanted an iOS friendly blog workflow I would have stayed with Octopress. It really is fantastic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are some things I don&#8217;t like about Tumblr. First, the iOS app lets you compose posts in markdown but presents you with the generated HTML if you try to edit them later. I really hope that gets fixed but actually the web editor is perfectly usable on an iPad so it&#8217;s not a deal-breaker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If Scriptogram gets some updates to fix the things I wasn&#8217;t happy with I could imagine moving the blog again as editing plain files on Dropbox is always going to be more flexible than using a proprietary editor be it web or app.</p>
