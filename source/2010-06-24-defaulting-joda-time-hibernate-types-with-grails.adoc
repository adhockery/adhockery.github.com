Grails 1.2 added the ability to define default Hibernate mappings that apply to all GORM classes. It turns out this is incredibly useful if you're using Joda-Time types instead of _java.util.Date_ in your domain objects. Previously you had to specify the Hibernate user type for every single field, like this:

----------------------------------------
import org.joda.time.*
import org.joda.time.contrib.hibernate.*

DateTime dateCreated
DateTime lastUpdated
LocalDate birthday

static mapping = {
    dateCreated type: PersistentDateTime
    lastUpdated type: PersistentDateTime
    birthday type: PersistentLocalDate
}
----------------------------------------

Now you can just add this to your _Config.groovy_ once and do away with the type mappings in the individual classes:

-----------------------------------------------------------
grails.gorm.default.mapping = {
    "user-type" type: PersistentDateTime, class: DateTime
    "user-type" type: PersistentLocalDate, class: LocalDate
}
-----------------------------------------------------------

*Correction:* I had previously posted that the method call in the default mapping DSL could be anything, but on further investigation it turns out it has to be _user-type_. Apologies for the error.

I'll look into the possibility of the Joda-Time plugin doing this itself to make things even easier.
