Spock's `old` method is one of my favorite features but today I ran into a limitation.

Spock also has a `with` method that makes the argument the delegate of a closure. This means you can avoid some boilerplate doing repeated assertions on the same target. For example:

[source,groovy]
----
expect:
with(aCollection) {
  size() > 0
  contains("foo")
  every { it != null }
}
----
