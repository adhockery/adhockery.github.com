I've finally got the first release of the Selenium RC plugin out of the door. Just run `grails install-plugin selenium-rc` to install.

For anyone unfamiliar with http://selenium-rc.seleniumhq.org/[Selenium RC] basically the plugin allows you to write and run Selenium tests in Groovy to functionally test Grails apps using a real browser. The tests run in the functional phase using `grails test-app` or `grails test-app -functional`.

In terms of compatibility there is a very minor issue with Safari and some slightly more annoying ones with IE - all of which the plugin's default configuration will work around for you. Unfortunately Firefox 3.5 on OSX Snow Leopard doesn't want to play at all due to an http://jira.openqa.org/browse/SRC-743[open Selenium bug]. Firefox on other platforms, Google Chrome and Opera all appear to be 100% compatible.

I've tried to make writing the tests themselves as similar to regular Grails unit and integration testing as possible. Not only that, if you have the http://grails.org/plugin/spock[Spock plugin] installed you can write your Selenium tests as Spock Specifications.

Documentation is http://grails.org/plugin/selenium-rc[here], source code is on http://github.com/robfletcher/grails-selenium-rc[GitHub] and issues and feature requests can be raised on http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GRAILSPLUGINS/component/14229[Codehaus' JIRA]. I've got plenty of things to work on for future releases such as Selenium Grid integration and automatic screen-grabbing when assertions fail.
