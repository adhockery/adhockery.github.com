    <div class="paragraph">
<p>The Java mocking library <a href="http://jmock.org/">jMock</a> has <a href="http://jmock.org/states.html">a nice feature for dealing with verifying mock interactions in stateful circumstances</a>. I first came across it when reading <a href="http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/">Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided By Tests</a> (<em>GOOS</em>) by Steve Freeman &amp; Nat Pryce.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was curious as to whether I could implement something similar with <em>Spock</em>. There&#8217;s no syntactic support right now (although there is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/spock/issues/detail?id=130">an open issue</a>) but it&#8217;s not that complex to achieve something adequate.</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
<p>When using <code>where</code> blocks in Spock there are two forms; assigning iterable values to a variable, e.g. <code>crew &lt;&lt; ['Mal', 'Kaylee', 'Jayne']</code> or using a datatable. In the first form I always knew you could use assigned values, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="groovy language-groovy">where:
crew &lt;&lt; ['Mal', 'Kaylee', 'Jayne']
nameLength = crew.length()</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Note the assignment operator used rather than the left shift on the second line there.</p>

<p>I blogged recently about <a href="http://blog.freeside.co/post/41774661851/testing-callbacks-with-spock-mocks">using Spock to test APIs that use callbacks</a>. The post came out of some work I&#8217;ve been doing with <a href="http://vertx.io/">Vert.x</a>. Although the tests I wrote worked, I found them rather mock-heavy and felt I wasn&#8217;t using the Vert.x API as idiomatically as I could have been.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been doing some work with <a href="http://vertx.io/">vert.x</a> over the last few days and trying to develop components that are test-driven. Like any asynchronous framework rather than having methods that return a value you pass a callback Closure that gets invoked at some point in the future with the result. This makes it tricky to write unit tests that mock out collaborators as you might in a traditional app.</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
<p>I use Spock almost exclusively to test Groovy or Java code these days. It&#8217;s got some fantastic features that other test frameworks don&#8217;t have. Some of them aren&#8217;t that well known or documented, though.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>old</code> method is possibly my favourite Spock feature. It&#8217;s a simple thing but really enhances test legibility. It&#8217;s also great for wowing developers new to Spock because it looks like black magic at first glance.</p>

<p>As projects grow the two things I&#8217;ve repeatedly found to be particularly painful have been functional testing and data fixtures. I might write up some thoughts on data fixtures another time but what follows is a brain-dump of my troubled relationship with functional testing.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Disclaimers:</em> I have more questions than answers and I&#8217;m completely open to the idea that <em>I&#8217;m doing it all wrong</em>. I&#8217;m not trying to diss any tool or technique here. I have spent a lot of time over the last few years writing functional test coverage so I think I at least have some perspective on the issues if no clue how to solve them.</p>

    </header>
    <div class="paragraph">
<p>Although most Grails controllers render HTML, JSON or XML output it is possible to use them to render binary data as well. We use a controller to render images uploaded by editors into our content management interface. The theory is simple enough, instead of using the <code>render</code> dynamic method or returning a <em>model</em> the controller action just writes bytes directly to the HTTP response stream. Our action looked something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="groovy language-groovy">def show = {
    def image = Image.read(params.id)
    if (image) {
        response.contentType = image.contentType
        response.outputStream.withStream { stream -&gt;
            stream &lt;&lt; image.bytes
        }
    } else {
        response.sendError SC_NOT_FOUND
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This seemed to work well enough. However when writing a test I noticed an odd thing. I was using <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/modules/http-builder/doc/rest.html">RESTClient</a> to scrape resource URLs out of and make a <em>HEAD</em> request against them to ensure the URLs were valid. Javascript and CSS files were working fine but all the non-static images in the page were getting 404s.</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
<p>Spock&#8217;s <code>where:</code> block is commonly used with a <a href="https://github.com/robfletcher/grails-enhanced-scaffolding/blob/master/test/projects/scaffolding-example/test/functional/scaffolding/InputTypesSpec.groovy#L18">data table</a> but can also be driven by any <code>Iterable</code> data. It&#8217;s worth bearing in mind that the data driving the <code>where:</code> block doesn&#8217;t have to be hardcoded, it can be dynamic. For example, today we implemented a spec to ensure that every table in our database schema has a primary key (because it&#8217;s required by <a href="http://ha-jdbc.sourceforge.net/">HA-JDBC</a> and not automatically added by GORM on join tables).</p>

<p>When creating artifacts such as domain classes, controllers and tag libs Grails generates a <em>JUnit</em> test case.
