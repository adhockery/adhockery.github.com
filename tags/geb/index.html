<p>As projects grow the two things I&#8217;ve repeatedly found to be particularly painful have been functional testing and data fixtures. I might write up some thoughts on data fixtures another time but what follows is a brain-dump of my troubled relationship with functional testing.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Disclaimers:</em> I have more questions than answers and I&#8217;m completely open to the idea that <em>I&#8217;m doing it all wrong</em>. I&#8217;m not trying to diss any tool or technique here. I have spent a lot of time over the last few years writing functional test coverage so I think I at least have some perspective on the issues if no clue how to solve them.</p>

<p>A frequent complaint about functional testing in Grails is that the start up / shut down cycle time of the app makes prototyping a functional test prohibitive. There has been some recent progress in this are with Luke Daley&#8217;s <a href="http://www.grails.org/plugin/functional-test-development">Functional test development plugin</a> but it would be really nice to be able to just run functional tests from inside your IDE in the same way as a similar unit test.</p>

<p>Geb <em>Page</em> and <em>Module</em> classes are just regular Groovy classes. In addition to the <em>content</em> DSL you can declare methods just as you would in any other class. Those methods can use content properties directly. This is really useful for encapsulating state and actions in a reusable way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this post I want to run through a couple of simple examples of re-usable <em>Module</em> classes that are enhanced with methods. Although the examples deal with <em>Module</em> classes everything here is equally applicable to <em>Page</em> classes.</p>

    </header>
    <div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://geb.codehaus.org/">Geb</a> is the hot new thing in Grails functional testing. One of its most powerful features is the concise DSL for defining page objects. The reasons for using page objects are <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects">well</a> <a href="http://robfletcher.github.com/grails-selenium-rc/docs/manual/guide/4.%20Using%20Page%20Objects.html">enumerated</a> <a href="http://geb.codehaus.org/manual/latest/pages.html#the_page_object_pattern_why">elsewhere</a> but the basic point is to allow your tests to interact with pages in a manner agnostic of the detail of their structure. This is both practical (you can change markup structure without having to fix numerous tests that only fail because they were tightly coupled to that structure) and aesthetic (your tests read more like a user&#8217;s interaction with the page - the <em>what</em> rather than the <em>how</em>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I want to put together a few short blog posts dealing with patterns that I find useful for defining page objects and modules in Geb. As I go I&#8217;ll keep adding to a very simple Grails project showing working examples which is <a href="https://github.com/robfletcher/geb-examples/">available on GitHub</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this post I want to talk about repeating data structures such as lists and tables and how to model them effectively.</p>
