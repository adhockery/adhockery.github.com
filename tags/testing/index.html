<p>One objection to the practice of TDD I&#8217;ve heard from several different people is along the lines of <em>“I don&#8217;t know exactly what I&#8217;m building at the outset, the code is experimental, so how can I write tests for it?”</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frequently it is the case that you have an idea but don&#8217;t know the mechanics of how you&#8217;re going to implement it. I find this particularly when I&#8217;m writing code that extends a third-party library. You don&#8217;t know exactly where the API hooks you&#8217;ll need to use are, your understanding of the API is fuzzy and you expect to learn it as you go. So how do you test-drive in that situation?</p>

<p>Spock&#8217;s <code>Mock</code> factory method (as well as factories for the other types of test double; <code>Stub</code> &amp; <code>Spy</code>) accepts a single interface representing the type you need a test double for.

<p>Groovy&#8217;s <em>power assert</em> and Hamcrest matchers both solve a similar problem – getting decent diagnostic information from an assertion failure. When writing JUnit or Spock tests in Groovy it&#8217;s typical to not use Hamcrest matchers as the <em>power assert</em> is so much simpler and just as effective. It&#8217;s worth bearing in mind, though that Hamcrest is also for helping clearly express the intent of an assertion. Spock provides support for Hamcrest matchers and I recently ran into a situation where I think it was the right thing to use.</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
<p>I spent an hour or so this morning figuring out how to unit test an Angular directive that uses a controller and a template loaded from a file (as opposed to inline). There&#8217;s a useful example in the <a href="https://github.com/vojtajina/ng-directive-testing">ng-directive-testing</a> repository but I thought a quick summary would be useful (as much to remind me the next time I have to do it as anything). Also the examples there test by interacting with DOM elements rather than directly with the directive&#8217;s scope.</p>

<p>When using <em>Mongo DB</em> with <em>GORM</em> it&#8217;s possible to assign to dynamic attributes of a domain class. However, you&#8217;ll find that when you write unit tests for code that uses this feature it isn&#8217;t supported. It&#8217;s easy to emulate, though.</p>

<p>The Java mocking library <a href="http://jmock.org/">jMock</a> has <a href="http://jmock.org/states.html">a nice feature for dealing with verifying mock interactions in stateful circumstances</a>.

<p>I was curious as to whether I could implement something similar with <em>Spock</em>. There&#8217;s no syntactic support right now (although there is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/spock/issues/detail?id=130">an open issue</a>) but it&#8217;s not that complex to achieve something adequate.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been pretty enthusiastic about <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> for a while now but although I was encouraged by the consideration given to testing hadn&#8217;t really tried unit testing my Angular components. I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://casperjs.org/">Casper</a> to test end-to-end which has been good enough for the experimental stuff I&#8217;d been doing with Angular. When I recently started working on a <em>real</em> app with a fairly complex Angular controller it felt like I needed to define the logic with some fine-grained unit tests.</p>

    </header>
    <div class="paragraph">
<p>When unit testing things that produce HTML output (such as some Grails taglibs) there are some common pitfalls. Comparing large chunks of markup with an expected string is very brittle; whitespace and attribute ordering becomes significant. Often people end up using regular expressions or assertions like <code>assert output.contains('&lt;div id="foo"&gt;')</code>. Whilst it may be a bit more maintainable this doesn&#8217;t really test correct DOM structure which is often important and again, attribute order can be a problem.</p>

<p>When testing an <a href="http://angularjs.org">Angular</a> application using <a href="http://casperjs.org/">Casper</a> I found that the binding between inputs and model didn&#8217;t seem to be happening when I filled in form fields. I used Casper&#8217;s <a href="http://casperjs.org/api.html#casper.fill"><code>fill</code></a> method but found that the Angular form validation was rejecting any required fields as though they were still blank. With some debugging I was able to see that the <code>$scope</code> variables indeed weren&#8217;t getting updated.</p>
