Since Java 8 introduced the `java.util.Optional` class there's been much debate about how and whether to use it.

Scala approaches the issue by allowing `null` but discouraging the use of it.
Idiomatic Scala doesn't use `null` but rather the `Option` monad.
However, there's no implicit conversion between `null` and `None` when dealing with Java APIs so either you avoid the use of Java libraries or you have the same problems as you do in Java 8.

Kotlin on the other hand takes a very pragmatic approach.
`null` exists but _behaves_ like an option type.
Types must be declared as nullable so a method that declares it returns `String` can not return `null` but a method that returns `String?` can.
Nullable types must be handled safely or the compiler will raise an error.
A nullable value is `"smart cast"` to non-null within any conditional statement that tests it.

In order to avoid very convoluted `null`-handling when dealing with Java APIs Kotlin's _KAnnotator_ tool can infer nullability of return types and parameters.
I've been pleasantly surprised how well KAnnotator works.
