A couple of people have asked me about the http://grails.org/plugin/springcache[Springcache plugin] and Grails 1.2. Currently the plugin is not compatible with 1.2-M3 and onwards. The reason for this is that the spring-modules-cache library that the plugin depends on is not compatible with Spring 3.0 which is used by the newest versions of Grails. Not only that but the https://springmodules.dev.java.net/[spring-modules project] has been discontinued altogether. There is http://github.com/astubbs/spring-modules[a fork of it on Github] but that doesn't look terribly active either. This means that at some point I'm going to have to sit down and write some code to bring the annotation driven caching inside the plugin itself and drop the spring-modules dependency. However, just to compound things the http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/ch08s09.html#aop-autoproxy-metadata[Spring documentation on the relevant area] hasn't been updated yet and still references the classes that have been removed from the API which is what's causing the incompatibility in the first place!

So, it's on my to-do list but don't hold your breath!
