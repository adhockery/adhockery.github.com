I just encountered a rather annoying problem when running http://hudson-ci.org/[Hudson] as a service on http://ubuntu.com/[Ubuntu]. I was getting the following exception whenever the build checked code out of http://github.com/[GitHub]:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hudson.plugins.git.GitException: Could not apply tag hudson-Selenium_RC_Plugin-23
 at hudson.plugins.git.GitAPI.tag(GitAPI.java:265)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It turns out Git needs a username to be set and the hudson user that the Debian package creates when Hudson is installed doesn't have one. Easily fixed by using `sudo nano /etc/passwd` to add `Hudson,,,` into the hudson user's entry (if you look at your own entry you should see where it needs to go).
