When using _Mongo DB_ with _GORM_ it's possible to assign to dynamic attributes of a domain class. However, you'll find that when you write unit tests for code that uses this feature it isn't supported. It's easy to emulate, though.

All domain classes that are enabled in a test using the `@TestFor` or `@Mock` annotations are available via `grailsApplication.domainClasses`. This means you can simply add something like this in your setup method:

[source,groovy]
------------------------------------------------------
for (domainClass in grailsApplication.domainClasses) {
    domainClass.metaClass.with {
        dynamicAttributes = [:]
        propertyMissing = { String name ->
            delegate.dynamicAttributes[name]
        }
        propertyMissing = { String name, value ->
            delegate.dynamicAttributes[name] = value
        }
    }
}
------------------------------------------------------

This is a pretty simplistic emulation of the real behavior â€“ any changes you make to dynamic attributes will take effect on the "persisted" domain instance even if the save fails. Generally I don't think it's likely there would be much ambiguity around that in a test but it's worth bearing in mind.
