<p>CSS3 includes a bunch of <code>transform</code> options allowing things like rotation &amp; distortion of element boxes. I wanted to apply that to achieve an effect inspired by <a href="https://www.google.com/images?q=googie+signage">mid 20th Century <em>Googie</em> signage</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My goal was to distort just the background behind an element whilst leaving the text alone. The text should also be able to "escape" from the background, for example letters can overflow beyond the background.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Naturally, being a CSS purist I also wanted to do all this without introducing non-semantic extra elements into the document.</p>

<p>Last week was the London Groovy &amp; Grails Exchange 2012 where I gave a talk called <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/groovy-grails/grails-for-hipsters">Grails for hipsters</a> about integrating Grails apps with some of the buzziest current tools &amp; techniques. Part of what I talked about was my approach to handling pre-processed front-end resources in Grails apps. In <a href="http://git.io/hipsteroid">the demo app</a> for my talk I used <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> &amp; <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> but everything I discusses applies equally to <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>, <a href="http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/">Stylus</a>, <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, etc.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot to like about <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>; it&#8217;s a fantastic resource for getting off the ground, particularly for getting a slick-looking admin interface up and running quickly. The recent changes to accommodate responsive layouts are really impressive. I&#8217;m particularly impressed with the way <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html#forms">horizontal forms</a> stack on smaller screens (failure to accommodate small screens in form design is something I&#8217;ve <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/rfletcherEW/status/161718223207804928">complained about before</a>).

    </header>
    <div class="paragraph">
<p>Although most Grails controllers render HTML, JSON or XML output it is possible to use them to render binary data as well. We use a controller to render images uploaded by editors into our content management interface. The theory is simple enough, instead of using the <code>render</code> dynamic method or returning a <em>model</em> the controller action just writes bytes directly to the HTTP response stream. Our action looked something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="groovy language-groovy">def show = {
    def image = Image.read(params.id)
    if (image) {
        response.contentType = image.contentType
        response.outputStream.withStream { stream -&gt;
            stream &lt;&lt; image.bytes
        }
    } else {
        response.sendError SC_NOT_FOUND
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This seemed to work well enough. However when writing a test I noticed an odd thing. I was using <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/modules/http-builder/doc/rest.html">RESTClient</a> to scrape resource URLs out of and make a <em>HEAD</em> request against them to ensure the URLs were valid. Javascript and CSS files were working fine but all the non-static images in the page were getting 404s.</p>

<p>Spock&#8217;s <code>where:</code> block is commonly used with a <a href="https://github.com/robfletcher/grails-enhanced-scaffolding/blob/master/test/projects/scaffolding-example/test/functional/scaffolding/InputTypesSpec.groovy#L18">data table</a> but can also be driven by any <code>Iterable</code> data. It&#8217;s worth bearing in mind that the data driving the <code>where:</code> block doesn&#8217;t have to be hardcoded, it can be dynamic. For example, today we implemented a spec to ensure that every table in our database schema has a primary key (because it&#8217;s required by <a href="http://ha-jdbc.sourceforge.net/">HA-JDBC</a> and not automatically added by GORM on join tables).</p>

    </header>
    <div class="paragraph">
<p>We’re developing an app that’s exclusively for a UK audience so i18n really isn’t an issue for us. However recently we got bitten by some i18n creeping in where we didn’t want it. Specifically, when using Grails’ <code>g:dateFormat</code> tag the default behaviour is to format the date according to the <code>Locale</code> specified in the user’s <code>Accept-Language</code> header. Even though we are explicitly specifying a format pattern for the date Java is aware of localized day names for some languages so the output can vary. The result is that on a page full of English text there suddenly appears a Spanish or Swedish day name. What makes things worse is that as we use server-side content caching and a CDN if a user with a non-English <code>Accept-Language</code> header is the first to see a particular page or bit of dynamically retrieved content then the cache is primed and until it expires <em>everyone</em> will see the non-English day name text. The solution in a Grails app is as simple as replacing Spring’s standard <code>localeResolver</code> bean with an instance of <code>FixedLocaleResolver</code>. Just add the following to <em>grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy</em>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="groovy language-groovy">localeResolver(org.springframework.web.servlet.i18n.FixedLocaleResolver, Locale.UK)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This changes the way Spring works out the request locale and any locale-aware tags should just fall into place.</p>

There was a question asked at the end that I felt in retrospect I could have answered better, though. I had mentioned that the Grails <a href="http://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/6.%20The%20Web%20Layer.html#6.7%20Ajax">AJAX tags</a> were something that should be avoided as they write script blocks directly into the page and event handlers directly onto HTML elements. I was pitching an approach based on a clean separation of clean semantic markup and script enhancements and inline script violates that separation.</p>

<p>Want to make an HTML element fill 100% of its parent&#8217;s width but also give it a border and/or some padding? Since the width of an element is <em>exclusive</em> of its border and padding this can be a pain. However there&#8217;s a fairly simple CSS solution that works cross-browser.</p>

<p>HTML5 specifies a number of enhancements to form inputs that are gradually being implemented by newer browsers. Among the enhancements is support for some level of automatic form validation.

<p>Grails scaffolding is a fantastic mechanism for getting you up and running quickly. I love the fact that you can provide your own implementation of <em>some</em> controller actions or views and scaffolding will just fill in the gaps. That way you can start hand-crafting things when complexity increases past a certain point but still have Grails do a bunch of work for you.</p>
