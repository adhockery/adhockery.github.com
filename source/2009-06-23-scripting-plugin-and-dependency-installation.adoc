Another quick script that I find quite useful, particularly on continuous integration servers is my http://gist.github.com/134689[Prepare.groovy] script. It solves a couple of problems

* Some plugins are not as well behaved as others on installation, for example http://grails.org/plugin/functional-test[the Functional Testing plugin] automatically installs when `test-app` or `run-app` is installed but will then immediately crash with a `ClassNotFoundException` because the libraries it depends on are not on the classpath yet. Re-running the command will then work but if the commands are part of a CI build it's probably already bombed out and reported a broken build.
* http://grails.org/plugin/ivy[The Ivy plugin] is great but `test-app` and `run-app` won't invoke its `get-dependencies` target to pull down libraries the way they will automatically install plugins.
* Sometimes the grails command you want the build to execute is supplied by a plugin so there's no convenient way to run it directly from a brand new workspace because the plugin isn't installed yet.

The script simply ensures all plugins are installed and then invokes the Ivy plugin's `get-dependencies` target (only if the Ivy plugin is installed - it won't blow up on you if you don't use Ivy). At that point you should have a fully workable workspace and be able to run any grails command you like without your app complaining that some library or other isn't present.
