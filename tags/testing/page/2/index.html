    </header>
    <div class="paragraph">
<p>I use Spock almost exclusively to test Groovy or Java code these days. It&#8217;s got some fantastic features that other test frameworks don&#8217;t have. Some of them aren&#8217;t that well known or documented, though.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>old</code> method is possibly my favourite Spock feature. It&#8217;s a simple thing but really enhances test legibility. It&#8217;s also great for wowing developers new to Spock because it looks like black magic at first glance.</p>

    </header>
    <div class="paragraph">
<p>Grails 2 has made a lot of improvements in unit testing support. One of the things I always used to find particularly painful was unit testing taglibs. Now when your test class is annotated with <code>@TestFor(MyTagLib)</code> you can use the <code>applyTemplate</code> method like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="groovy language-groovy">expect:
applyTemplate('&lt;my:tag/&gt;') == 'the expected output'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, one thing I found is that it&#8217;s quite tricky to wire a dependency in to the taglib instance that&#8217;s used by the <code>applyTemplate</code> method.</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
<p>A frequent complaint about functional testing in Grails is that the start up / shut down cycle time of the app makes prototyping a functional test prohibitive. There has been some recent progress in this are with Luke Daley&#8217;s <a href="http://www.grails.org/plugin/functional-test-development">Functional test development plugin</a> but it would be really nice to be able to just run functional tests from inside your IDE in the same way as a similar unit test.</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
<p>Geb <em>Page</em> and <em>Module</em> classes are just regular Groovy classes. In addition to the <em>content</em> DSL you can declare methods just as you would in any other class. Those methods can use content properties directly. This is really useful for encapsulating state and actions in a reusable way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this post I want to run through a couple of simple examples of re-usable <em>Module</em> classes that are enhanced with methods. Although the examples deal with <em>Module</em> classes everything here is equally applicable to <em>Page</em> classes.</p>

    </header>
    <div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="http://geb.codehaus.org/">Geb</a> is the hot new thing in Grails functional testing. One of its most powerful features is the concise DSL for defining page objects. The reasons for using page objects are <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects">well</a> <a href="http://robfletcher.github.com/grails-selenium-rc/docs/manual/guide/4.%20Using%20Page%20Objects.html">enumerated</a> <a href="http://geb.codehaus.org/manual/latest/pages.html#the_page_object_pattern_why">elsewhere</a> but the basic point is to allow your tests to interact with pages in a manner agnostic of the detail of their structure. This is both practical (you can change markup structure without having to fix numerous tests that only fail because they were tightly coupled to that structure) and aesthetic (your tests read more like a user&#8217;s interaction with the page - the <em>what</em> rather than the <em>how</em>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I want to put together a few short blog posts dealing with patterns that I find useful for defining page objects and modules in Geb. As I go I&#8217;ll keep adding to a very simple Grails project showing working examples which is <a href="https://github.com/robfletcher/geb-examples/">available on GitHub</a>.</p>

    </header>
    <div class="paragraph">
<p>Grails controllers and tag libs can access any tag as though it were a method. The most common use for this is probably accessing i18n messages via the <code>[g:message][1]</code> tag. However, because tag access is magic wired up by Grails it&#8217;s not available in unit tests without some effort.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a perennial nuisance. Not exactly difficult to solve and yet something I find myself solving over and over in different tests and different projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve come up with what I think is a pretty good and re-usable solution. It allows you to specify messages if you want to, or just use the message code if it&#8217;s not something you care about in a particular test. As an aside, at a unit test level, I think testing that the correct message <em>code</em> is being used is probably the right thing to do; I&#8217;d leave testing actual message text to end-to-end tests.</p>
