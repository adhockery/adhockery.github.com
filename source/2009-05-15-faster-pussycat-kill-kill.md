I mentioned previously that we'd seen some speed improvements in our page load time after upgrading to Grails 1.1. It turns out that for the week 3rd May to 10th May [Sky Showbiz][1] ranked 8th in the UK for page response time in the [Gomez][2] Benchmark Report with an average of 1.84 seconds. We came in ahead of some heavyweights like Amazon, HSBC, British Airways, etc. Sure, we weren't even close to Google (0.35 seconds!) and we rely on heavy caching for most of our responsiveness, but it's not bad for a site that's basically 8 virtual nodes (6 web and 2 DB) running a Grails app on Jetty and PostgreSQL.
