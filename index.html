<p>Peter Ledbrook wrote an interesting post <a href="http://blog.cacoethes.co.uk/software/exploring-kotlin">Exploring Kotlin</a> about his initial experiences with Kotlin.
Since I&#8217;ve been getting quite into Kotlin recently I thought I&#8217;d follow that up with some of my own observations as well as responding to some of the questions he raised.</p>

    </header>
    <div class="paragraph">
<p>Yesterday I posted about <a href="http://blog.freeside.co/2015/01/29/simple-background-polling-with-rxjava/">an implementation of a simple remote service polling mechanism</a> using <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava">RxJava</a>. One of the things I particularly liked when applying this pattern at work was how straightforward it was to unit test.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Often when dealing with asynchronous processing unit testing can be pretty painful. Typically you need to use a mechanism such as Java&#8217;s <code>CountDownLatch</code> or Spock&#8217;s <code>BlockingVariables</code> or <code>PollingConditions</code> to synchronize threads before making assertions. Allowing processing to run asynchronously, especially when testing scheduled activity can make tests very slow as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ideally tests the asynchronous nature of the code is abstracted and the timer can be faked out. This is exactly the approach that RxJava takes.</p>

    </header>
    <div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve done odd bits of playing around with RxJava before but never dived into it very deeply. Today I wanted to re-implement an unreliable background polling operation and <a href="https://twitter.com/tomaslin">Tomás Lin</a> suggested I look at using <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava">RxJava</a>. This may be an obvious implementation to some but I had to do a bit of experimentation (and searching Stack Overflow) to come up with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine we&#8217;re polling a web-service regularly. The service returns a JSON array of independent items (think events since last poll, Tweets with a particular hashtag or something similar). We want to do some processing (filtering, parsing to a type) on each item and then pass them off to a handler.</p>

    </header>
    <div class="paragraph">
<p>For years I&#8217;ve used the Joda Time library to provide a nicer alternative to the horrible mutable <code>java.util.Date</code> class and the terrifying abyss of <code>java.util.Calendar</code>. One thing, as a fanatical tester, that really appealed to me was the existence of the <code>DateTimeUtils</code> class. All the Joda Time types use <code>DateTimeUtils</code> as a source of the current instant and it exposes methods that allow tests to fix or offset the value that&#8217;s returned. That can rule out some irritating flakiness in tests and enable testing of time zone / daylight savings bugs, timeout logic and so on while retaining the encapsulation of timestamp generation in production code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, when you look at <code>DateTimeUtils</code> with purist eyes it&#8217;s a horrible hack. A static singleton encapsulating global mutable state! I guess that was the attitude of those responsible for JSR-352 that created the new <code>java.time</code> package which is largely based on Joda Time. One of the things that <em>wasn&#8217;t</em> carried over from Joda Time is the <code>DateTimeUtils</code> class. Instead factory methods such as <code>Instant.now()</code> use a <code>Clock</code> object – by default <code>Clock.systemUTC()</code>.</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
<p>One objection to the practice of TDD I&#8217;ve heard from several different people is along the lines of <em>“I don&#8217;t know exactly what I&#8217;m building at the outset, the code is experimental, so how can I write tests for it?”</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frequently it is the case that you have an idea but don&#8217;t know the mechanics of how you&#8217;re going to implement it. I find this particularly when I&#8217;m writing code that extends a third-party library. You don&#8217;t know exactly where the API hooks you&#8217;ll need to use are, your understanding of the API is fuzzy and you expect to learn it as you go. So how do you test-drive in that situation?</p>

<p>Spock&#8217;s <code>Mock</code> factory method (as well as factories for the other types of test double; <code>Stub</code> &amp; <code>Spy</code>) accepts a single interface representing the type you need a test double for.

<p>Groovy&#8217;s <em>power assert</em> and Hamcrest matchers both solve a similar problem – getting decent diagnostic information from an assertion failure. When writing JUnit or Spock tests in Groovy it&#8217;s typical to not use Hamcrest matchers as the <em>power assert</em> is so much simpler and just as effective. It&#8217;s worth bearing in mind, though that Hamcrest is also for helping clearly express the intent of an assertion. Spock provides support for Hamcrest matchers and I recently ran into a situation where I think it was the right thing to use.</p>

<p>I find Groovy Closures can sometimes behave in ways that, once I think about it, make perfect sense but initially seem surprising.

<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of Groovy&#8217;s <code>@CompileStatic</code> feature – so much so that I&#8217;ve updated the <em>Groovy class</em> template in IntelliJ IDEA to use it by default.

<p>Recently <a href="https://twitter.com/pledbrook/status/475986668840050688">Peter Ledbrook reminded me of one drawback</a> which is that method dispatch is statically bound when using <code>@CompileStatic</code> like it is in Java. This means that the behavior of calling polymorphic methods can change when argument types are not known at compile time.</p>
