I gave a talk last night at the [London Groovy & Grails User Group][2] about the [Selenium RC plugin][3] and how to use it. I pitched the talk assuming that people were somewhat familiar with [Selenium][4] and had probably used the [Selenium IDE][5]. I'm not sure if that was the right way to go but the talk went pretty well and people seemed interested in what I had to say. I ended up talking a lot about the [page object pattern][6] and how awesome it is for building manageable suites of Selenium tests.

I really wanted to show a few quick examples but I had neglected to consider that a [mini display port VGA adapter][7] might be a useful thing to bring and unfortunately with Skills Matter being in the middle of an office move there wasn't one to hand. Luckily I was able to borrow a laptop so at least I could get my slides up on the projector.
