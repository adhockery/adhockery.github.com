    </header>
    <div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s a fairly popular technique in Grails plugin development where the plugin has <em>test apps</em> stored in <code>test/projects/*</code>, each of which references the plugin by including <code>grails.plugin.location."my-plugin" = "../../.."</code> in its <em>BuildConfig.groovy</em>. Doing this allows you as a plugin developer to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Automate tests for sample projects using the plugin with significantly different configurations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test using domain classes, controllers, etc. that shouldn&#8217;t be packaged with the plugin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test drive, changing code in both the test app and the plugin without the need to use <code>grails package-plugin</code> or <code>grails install-plugin</code> to pick up changes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The downside is that to run all the plugin project&#8217;s tests it&#8217;s necessary to run the plugin&#8217;s own tests, then change directory into each of the test apps and run their tests. Continuous integration config is also fiddlier for the same reason.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://blog.freeside.co/post/42902733548/selenium-rc-tests-with-a-remote-app">posted recently</a> about the new remote mode feature of the <a href="http://grails.org/plugin/selenium-rc">Selenium RC plugin</a>. One thing I forgot to mention is that this feature can also be used to run your Selenium tests interactively against a running app instance. You can start your app as normal using <code>grails run-app</code> then either open a second terminal or background the process (<em>Ctrl-Z</em> in a <em>bash</em> shell) then use <code>grails -Dselenium.remote=true test-app other:selenium _&lt;test name&gt;_</code> to run individual tests without stopping or re-starting the app. With the app running <em>development</em> mode you can effectively test-drive using Selenium tests and Grails' artefact reloading capabilities.</p>

The <em>mockDomain</em> method is particularly useful for simulating the various enhancements Grails adds to domain classes. However, there are some domain class capabilities, such as criteria queries and the new <a href="http://grails.org/doc/latest/ref/Domain%20Classes/namedQueries.html">named queries</a>, that can&#8217;t really be simulated by <em>mockDomain</em>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve just released a new snapshot of the <a href="http://grails.org/plugin/selenium-rc">Selenium RC plugin</a>. The main new feature is the ability to run your Selenium tests against a running instance of your application instead of having the application start and stop as part of the test phase. A number of people have requested this. It&#8217;s really useful for CI environments where you may want to start the app up on a different server from where the tests are being run.</p>

<p>After <a href="http://blog.freeside.co/post/42902700224/springcache-plugin-status">saying it might take me a while</a> I got stuck in and rewrote the Springcache plugin from scratch. The new version is up now. The plugin now requires Grails 1.2.0-M3 or greater as it&#8217;s reliant on Spring 3.0.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2009/11/26/springcache-plugin-status/">Springcache Plugin Status</a></h2>
    </header>
    <div class="paragraph">
<p>A couple of people have asked me about the <a href="http://grails.org/plugin/springcache">Springcache plugin</a> and Grails 1.2. Currently the plugin is not compatible with 1.2-M3 and onwards. The reason for this is that the spring-modules-cache library that the plugin depends on is not compatible with Spring 3.0 which is used by the newest versions of Grails. Not only that but the <a href="https://springmodules.dev.java.net/">spring-modules project</a> has been discontinued altogether. There is <a href="http://github.com/astubbs/spring-modules">a fork of it on Github</a> but that doesn&#8217;t look terribly active either. This means that at some point I&#8217;m going to have to sit down and write some code to bring the annotation driven caching inside the plugin itself and drop the spring-modules dependency. However, just to compound things the <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/ch08s09.html#aop-autoproxy-metadata">Spring documentation on the relevant area</a> hasn&#8217;t been updated yet and still references the classes that have been removed from the API which is what&#8217;s causing the incompatibility in the first place!</p>

    </header>
    <div class="paragraph">
<p>Mostly I love Groovy but every now and then some behaviour gets on my nerves. For example, why do the iterator methods on String behave as though it was a collections of characters rather than an Object? If I define a method with a dynamic-typed parameter like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="groovy language-groovy">void printNames(names) {
    names.each {
        println it
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Passing a collection of Strings results in each String being printed. Passing a single String results in each character of the String being printed separately. I would have thought that the Object behaviour was a more appropriate default here (iterators on Object are called once passing the object itself). After all the <code>.chars</code> property is available if you really want to represent a String as a collection of characters.</p>

I pitched the talk assuming that people were somewhat familiar with <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/docs/">Selenium</a> and had probably used the <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/">Selenium IDE</a>. I&#8217;m not sure if that was the right way to go but the talk went pretty well and people seemed interested in what I had to say. I ended up talking a lot about the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/webdriver/wiki/PageObjects">page object pattern</a> and how awesome it is for building manageable suites of Selenium tests.</p>
