      <h1>Grails Gotcha: Beware HEAD requests when rendering binary output in controllers</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="paragraph">
<p>Although most Grails controllers render HTML, JSON or XML output it is possible to use them to render binary data as well. We use a controller to render images uploaded by editors into our content management interface. The theory is simple enough, instead of using the <code>render</code> dynamic method or returning a <em>model</em> the controller action just writes bytes directly to the HTTP response stream. Our action looked something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="groovy language-groovy">def show = {
    def image = Image.read(params.id)
    if (image) {
        response.contentType = image.contentType
        response.outputStream.withStream { stream -&gt;
            stream &lt;&lt; image.bytes
        }
    } else {
        response.sendError SC_NOT_FOUND
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This seemed to work well enough. However when writing a test I noticed an odd thing. I was using <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/modules/http-builder/doc/rest.html">RESTClient</a> to scrape resource URLs out of and make a <em>HEAD</em> request against them to ensure the URLs were valid. Javascript and CSS files were working fine but all the non-static images in the page were getting 404s.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Initially I suspected a data setup problem and spent some time ensuring my test was setting data up properly. It was only once I put some debug logging in the controller action that I saw that the controller <em>was</em> actually loading images. The 404 was not coming from the <em>else</em> block in the action as I initially assumed. I tried changing the <em>RESTClient</em> call from <em>head</em> to <em>get</em> and suddenly the image URLs started working!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once I did that I realised what the problem was. An HTTP <em>HEAD</em> request does not expect a response, in fact a server receiving a <em>HEAD</em> request <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.4"><em>must not</em> return a response</a>. The response stream that our controller action is writing to is, when the request method is <em>HEAD</em>, actually a no-op stream. When the action completes Grails checks to see if anything has been committed to the response stream and since it has not assumes that we want to render a view by convention. You can probably see where this is going now. The convention is that the request gets forwarded to <code>grails-app/views/&lt;controller&gt;/&lt;action&gt;.gsp</code> which of course does not exist. The forwarded request sets a response code of <em>404</em> because there is no GSP!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We caught this bug in our app completely by accident but it could actually have been quite serious. Caching proxies and CDNs may well use a <em>HEAD</em> request to revalidate content and on getting a <em>404</em> assume that the URL is no longer valid. If the <em>404</em> response itself then gets cached we could get broken images on our site because the CDN tells the client browser there&#8217;s nothing there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The solution is simple enough. I changed the controller action to simply set a <em>200</em> response code when it gets a <em>HEAD</em> request for a valid image:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="groovy language-groovy">def show = {
    def image = Image.read(params.id)
    if (image) {
        if (request.method == "HEAD") {
            render SC_OK
        } else {
            response.contentType = image.contentType
            response.outputStream.withStream { stream -&gt;
                stream &lt;&lt; image.bytes
            }
        }
    } else {
        response.sendError SC_NOT_FOUND
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A neater solution might be to use Grails' support for <a href="http://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/6.%20The%20Web%20Layer.html#6.4.5%20Mapping%20to%20HTTP%20methods">mapping actions to request methods</a> so that <em>GET</em> and <em>HEAD</em> requests dispatch to different actions.</p>
